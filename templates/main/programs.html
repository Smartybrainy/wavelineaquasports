                        Exercising in a low impact environment is the best replacement for jogging and this is what swimming gives you.

                        Swim for all is an initiative of Wave-line Aqua Sports, aimed at growing the swimming community in Nigeria Primary and Secondary Schools. Our main focus is to give back to the society and enable youngsters become water safe and acquire swimming skills for safety, recreation and develop sportsmanship disposition.

                        We believe that apart from reducing drowning risks by ensuring these kids are equipped with water safety skills, some of them can someday become world champions in swimming for Nigeria. We achieve this by conducting free swimming teaching services to them.
